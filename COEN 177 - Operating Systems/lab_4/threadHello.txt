When we run the threadHello file, we get produced a different thread ID for each of the threads. 

If you run more demanding programs, you would have even more spaced out IDs 

the arg passed as a local variable is per-thread since it is being passed through the pthread_create function

The local variable in main() is shared state

It ould just output the thread ID for the last thread
